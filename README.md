## Overview
The goal of these projects is to explore the implementation of Anomaly Detection in time series using Autoencoders.
* Import Libraries and Dataset
* Data Analysis and Engineering
* Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder
* Visualize Data

## Business Understanding
Anomaly Detection systems have a lot of useful use cases for many businesses. From QoS (quality of service) in Telcom to Fraud detection in fintech.
The use cases here will cover the following scenarios:
* RSSI Wifi Anomaly - example: the quality of service provided to an user can be compromised when there are low RSSI values (for this dataset, high RSSI values);
* Temperature Anomaly - example: identifying temperature anomalies can reduce costs and food wasting in food wharehouses. 

## Future Work
These projects are simple in order to explore and understand the basics.
Upcoming work will contemplate further analysis, models fine-tune and other use cases that require different approachs to Anomaly Detection Systems.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10.6 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
